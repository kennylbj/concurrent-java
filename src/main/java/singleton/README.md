Implement Singleton pattern

### Singletons

1. EagerSingleton
>> It is simplest and thread safe version of Singleton.
However, the instance is created even though application might not be using it.

2. LazySingleton
>> Overcome the drawback of EagerSingleton, but it's NOT thread-safe.

3. SynchronizedSingleton
>> Thread-safe but reduces the performance because of cost associated with the synchronized method.
 
4. DoubleCheckSingleton
>>Warning: DON'T use it. This implement is incorrect!

5. VolatileSingleton
>> Warning: this implement is limited by JDK version("volatile" semantics guarantee).
Work fine while JDK is not less than 1.5.

6. InnerStaticClassSingleton
>> Use inner static class helpler to initialize instance.
It's prefer to implement Singleton using this approach.

7. EnumSingleton
>> Effective Java suggests to implement singleton using this approach.
However it may occur some memory-waste issues.

### Summary

Use [LazySingleton](LazySingleton.java) If there is not thread-safe requirement;
Otherwise use [InnerStaticClassSingleton](InnerStaticClassSingleton.java).
