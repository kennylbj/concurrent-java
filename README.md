# concurrent-java
Multi-threads programing philosophy in java.

## Summary
Each package contains some concept-specified questions and my solution.

## Motivation
My friend is new to java concurrency programing, so I set up this project to help him to have a better knowledge about how to code in multi-threads environment. This project takes advantage of several awesome books such as ``Java Concurrency in Practice`` , ``Effective Java`` and extracts the most important concept of concurrency programing. What's more, it demonstrates the usage of some popular utils including ``guava`` and ``rxjava``. Feel free to enjoy it.  

I will continue to post updates.
